# emacs: Accented characters

From (John D Cook)[https://www.johndcook.com/blog/emacs_unicode/]

How can I enter accented letters not present on your keyboard?
You can type C-x 8 followed by a punctuation mark and the letter to accent. For example, C-x 8 ’ e inserts é. The punctuation marks used to specify accents are fairly mnemonic. Here are some of the more common examples.

Accent	   Example	   Result
grave	     C-x 8 ` e	   è
acute	     C-x 8 ’ e	   é
circumflex C-x 8 ^ o	   ô
tilde	     C-x 8 ~ n	   ñ
umlaut	   C-x 8 " o	   ö
cedilla	   C-x 8 , c	   ç

For more information, type C-x 8 C-h

How can I enter arbitrary Unicode characters?
C-x 8 RET followed by either the code point in hex or the name of the official Unicode name of the character.

How can I find out information about a character?
C-u C-x = will give information about the character under the cursor.

How can I tell what encoding your file is using?
Type C-h C RET. (Note that’s an upper case C.) This will tell you the coding system for the current buffer and much more.

How can I change a file’s encoding?
C-x RET f will prompt you for an encoding. You could then enter utf-8, for example, to specify UTF-8 encoding.
