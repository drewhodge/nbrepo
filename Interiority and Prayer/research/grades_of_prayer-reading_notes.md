1. [p.355] Major works: _The Life_ (1565), _The Way of Perfection_ (1556), _The Interior Castle_.
2. [p.355] Read spiritual authors outside the Carmelite tradition:
	- _Third Spiritual Alphabet_, Francisco de Osuna
	- _Ascent of Mount Simon_, Bernardino de _**Laredo**_
3. [p.356] Osuna's book covered the prayer of recollection, which Teresa found "delightful".

<!-- The Life -->
4. [p.356] In _The Life_ and _The Way of Perfection_--Teresa covers the ascetical grades of prayer. In _The Interior Castle_ she covers the higher grades of mystical prayer.
5. [p.356] One's prayer life must follow various stages of prayer. 
6. [p.357] _Life_--prayer is like watering a garden. **First stage of prayer** affective prayer, vocal prayer and discursive meditation. Francis de Sales describes this as the stage in which "the intellect rather than the affections" are used.
7. [p.358] **Second stage of prayer** (watering the garden using a watering wheel and buckets).  This is the prayer of quiet. Described as "an affective type of recollected prayer", which is the "predisposition" for "mystical contemplative prayer".
8. [p.360] **Third stage of prayer** (watering using a stream). This requires no human effort--totally passive and mystical. In this stage the soul has union with God, but not yet complete union.
9. [p.361] **Fourth stage of prayer** (watering by falling rain). This is the prayer of full union with God.
10. [p.361] Teresa did not write a systematic theology of prayer. Aumann says that "precise terminology to describe the grades of ascetical prayer and the transitional prayer leading to comtemplation did not come into use until the seventeenth century at the hands of Francis de Sales et al.
11. [p.362] Teresa was writing from her own experience--"it is possible that St. Teresa herself passed almost from meditative prayer to infused, mystical prayer."

<!-- The Way of Perfection -->
12. [p.362] _The Way of Perfection_, begun in 1556--notable distinction between active recollection and the prayer of quiet (the beginning of pure contemplation). 
13. [p.362] Commentary on the Lord's Prayer, chs.28,28--Teresa's description of the prayer of active recollection. "This prayer is called 'recollection' because the soul collects its faculties together and enters within itself to be with its God."--_The Way of Perfection_, 28.4.
14. [p.363] Teresa's commentary--"an instruction on how to use vocal prayer as a means for attaining to the prayer of recollection", but it also explains the 'prayer of quiet', which is a type of contemplation.
15. [p.364] Characteristics of the prayer of quiet are peace and joy.
16. [p.364] Teresa leaves a full explanation of the 'prayer of union' until _The Interior Castle_.

<!-- The Interior Castle -->
17. [p.364] _The Interior Castle_, 1557. Describes the soul as a castle made of diamond that contains seven rooms. At the centre is the principal room where God and the soul commune.
18. [p.365] The first three of the seven rooms are associated with "the ascetical or active phase of prayer". The fourth to the seventh mansions are associated with various stages of mystical prayer.
19. [p.365] Teresa "refines" her descriptions of the grades of prayer and distinguishes between 'acquired' and 'infused' recollection, elaborates on the 'prayer of quiet, and on 'sensible consolations' and 'infused spiritual delights'.
20. [p.366] Synonymns for the 'prayer of recollection'. Chs 3 and 4 of _The Interior Castle_ are associated with this grade of prayer.
21. [p.366] In the fourth mansion, Teresa states that prayer begins "to touch the supernatural". She describes the 'parader of quiet', which she also calls 'a prayer of consolations from God'. She also discusses 'infused' or 'passive recollection'.
22. [p.367] The prayer of 'infused recollection' is Teresa's lowest grade of mystical prayer.  
23. [p.368] The fourth mansion, Teresa says, is the one which the "greatest number of souls enter". And the two grades of prayer associated with this stage are 'infused, passive recollection' and the 'prayer of quiet'.
24. [p.368] In the fifth to the seventh mansions, Teresa describes the stages of the 'prayer of union'--this consumes eleven chapters of the book.
25. [p.369] In the seventh mansion, Teresa describes the 'highest state of prayer that it is possible to attain in this life'--the prayer of 'transforming union' or 'spiritual marriage'.

<!-- Aumann's summary -->
26. [p.369] Aumann summarizes the development of Teresa's though/teaching on prayer, as seen in her major written work.
27. [p.370] Aumann's schema of Teresa's grades of prayer:
   - **Vocal Prayer**--attention to what one is saying or reading and to God whom one is addressing.
   - **Meditation**--at first discursive and later becoming affective prayer.
   - **Acquired Recollection**--in modern terms, the prayer of simplicity, simple regard, acquired contemplation, and centering prayer.
   - **Infused Recollection**--the first fully passive and mystical grade of prayer.
   - **Prayer of Quiet**--sometime reaching the intensity of the 'sleep of the faculties'.
   - **Prayer of Simple Union**--in which the intellect and will are captive, but the other faculties are free.
   - **Prayer of Ecstatic Union**--in which all the faculties are suspended; often leading to mystical espousal or conforming union.
   - **Prayer of Transforming Union**--also known as mystical marriage, which is the highest grade of prayer.
28. [p.370] Two concepts that form the basis of Teresa's teaching on prayer:
   - The presence of God in the soul.
   - Recollection, or interiorization, on the part of the individual.
29. [p.371] Jesus said the the Kingdom of God is within us. For Teresa, this meant that God is found in the 'throne room of the soul, the interior castle'. To enter the throne room, one must 'detach oneself from everything outside' the soul and move through the various stages of prayer (mansions in the castle) until one gets to the centre.  This is the goal of all prayer.
30. [p.371] Prayer and meditation enable one to enter the castle.  That is, one must 'cultivate the practice of recollection', which cannot be done without detachment.
31. [p.371] Determination on the part of the soul moves one upwards through the various stages of prayer beginning with vocal prayer.  Most people will move through acquired recollection and into the first fully passive and mystical prayer of infused recollection.  To move further requires 'complete docility' to the Holy Spirit.
