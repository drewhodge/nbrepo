# Teresa's 'prayer of recollection'

From: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

The prayer of recollection is a type of meditation in which the person seeks to still their mind and focus on God. This involves letting go of all distractions and external concerns, and turning inward to connect with the divine. According to Teresa, the prayer of recollection is an essential part of the spiritual life, as it allows the person to cultivate a deeper relationship with God and to find peace and calm in their innermost being.

Teresa wrote extensively about the prayer of recollection and its importance in her works, including "The Interior Castle" and "The Way of Perfection." She emphasised the need to practice this type of prayer regularly in order to cultivate a strong inner life and to grow closer to God.
