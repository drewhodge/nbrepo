1. Vocal Prayer: being attentive to the words one is saying and/or reading with focus on God, whom one is addressing. 
2. Discursive Meditation: application of one's mind to spiritual truth; in order to penetrate its meaning and carry it into practice.
3. Affective Mental Prayer: the operation of the will predominates over the intellect. A simplified meditation where love predominates. Prayer becomes "the language of love." 
4. Acquired Recollection: or the prayer of simplicity: a simple love or gaze on some Divine Object, whether it be the Crucifix, the Eucharist or the loving awareness of some Christian truth or mystery.
5. Infused Recollection: the first degree of infused, mystical contemplation, a cooperation with God the Holy Spirit. The other methods of prayer are abandoned to be present, an experience of God.
6. Prayer of Quiet: Captivated by divine love; the awareness of God's presence, the soul is filled with sweetness and joy. sometimes all the faculties are captivated (ecstasy).
7. Prayer of Simple Union: both the intellect and the will are captivated and occupied with God.
8. Prayer of Ecstatic Union: also the "mystical espousal" or "conforming union." The Soul is centred on God alone.
9. Prayer of Transforming Union: also called the "mystical marriage" a prelude to the beatific life of glory and the most intimate union of the soul with God. Transformation of the soul into it's Beloved...
