This course will be given through Zoom in the fall of 2021, over six evenings, from 6:30 to 8:30, on Tuesdays October 12, 19 and 26, and on Thursday October 14, 21 and 28. 

The course will offer students an opportunity, first, to explore their own interiority, thanks to the self-knowledge provided by the Canadian Jesuit Bernard Lonergan; and second, to identify more clearly their difficulties in prayer and their own way of praying, and possibly to modify it. 

To achieve the first goal, student will philosophically clarify the dynamic structure of human interiority, with its knowledge and its affectivity; this analysis will equip them for a well-ordered understanding of spirituality and for good catechetical teaching. 

To achieve the second goal, various views on prayer will be examined, mainly in the Bible, among a few ancient and medieval authors, in St. Thomas Aquinas, and among modern prayerful people. Spiritual and psychological aspects of maturing in prayer will also be discussed.
