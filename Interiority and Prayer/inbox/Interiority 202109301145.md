# Interiority (defn)
From: [Catholic Classics and Interioirty (Seton Hall University)](https://catholicclassicsinteriority.site/lessons/lesson-1-definition/)


"The term “interiority” may seem ambiguous. Overall, interiority means analyzing the inner life of ourselves, others, texts, any expression of thought, examining the inner life and reflecting on common sense. Humans have a common response to certain objective events, a response that was basic to the religious experience of the earliest believers in the Church. Even the Old Testament people, the ancient Greeks and Romans, up to St. Thomas Aquinas in the Middle Ages experienced faith interiorly. The concept of “interiority” was developed in modern times, but it is human to have an interior life because we have rational souls. Interiority is a _defined method_ for reflecting on the inner life."

Slight paraphrasal.
