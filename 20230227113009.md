# emacs: Toggle emacs/vim modes/states

Emacs stste: `C-z` --Vim keys are disabled completely.
Vim insert: `i`
Vim normal: `ESC`

## Modes and states
The next time Emacs is started, it will come up in normal state, denoted by ~<N>~ in the mode line. This is where the main vi bindings are defined. Note that you can always disable normal state with ~C-z~, which switches to an “Emacs state” (denoted by ~<E>~) in which vi keys are completely disabled. Press ~C-z~ again to switch back to normal state.

### state
Evil uses the term state for what is called a “mode” in regular vi usage, because modes are understood in Emacs terms to mean something else.
Evil defines a number of states by default:

### normal state (<N>)
This is the default “resting state” of Evil, in which the main body of vi bindings are defined.

### insert state (<I>)
This is the state for insertion of text, where non-modified keys will insert the corresponding character in the buffer.

### visual state (<V>)
A state for selecting text regions. Motions are available for modifying the selected region, and operators are available for acting on it.

### replace state (<R>)
A special state mostly similar to insert state, except it replaces text instead of inserting.

### operator-pending state (<O>)
A special state entered after launching an operator, but before specifying the corresponding motion or text object.

### motion state (<M>)
A special state useful for buffers that are read-only, where motions are available but editing operations are not.

### Emacs state (<E>)
A state that as closely as possible mimics default Emacs behaviour, by eliminating all vi bindings, except for C-z, to re-enter normal state.
