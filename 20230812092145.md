# helix: troubleshooting

## LSPs

### rust-analyzer

Confirm that RA is in your path by running `command -v rust-analyzer` - if it 
outputs the path, you're good.

Run `hx --health | grep rust` to check if Helix is picking up on rust-analyzer. 
If you see any x's, that's something to look into (remove the grep pipe for 
full context)

Run `hx -v src/main.rs` (or with whatever path you have for a rust file) then 
exit with `:q`. Open the log file `hx ~/.cache/helix/helix.log` and look for 
any errors that could be related.

Open up two terminal panes side-by-side and run `tail -f ~/.cache/helix/helix.log`
in one, then `hx -v src/main.rs` in the other. That way you can see the logs 
in real time.
