# linux: Super key

1. Single short tap of "Super" (windows key). That should be what one would normally get by hitting the "Activities button" (top left). Reverts by tapping Super again.

2. Super-S. Should be same as (1). Aside: You can use your arrow keys (->, <-, etc to move/select application focus).

3. Quick double-tap of "Super". That should be what one would normally get by clicking on the bottom left "Show Applications" button. This might be what you're describing you're now getting from the "Activities" button. Reverts by tapping Super.

4. 3 should be the same as Super-A. Let's you choose "workspaces" (top) or search for applications to run or documents to open.
