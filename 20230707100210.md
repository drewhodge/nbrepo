# emacs: accented characters

  grave         	C-x 8 ` e     	è
  acute         	C-x 8 ’ e     	é
  circumflex    	C-x 8 ^ o     	ô
  tilde         	C-x 8 ~ n     	ñ
  umlaut	        C-x 8 " o	      ö
  cedilla	        C-x 8 , c	      ç

## Type arbitrary Unicode characters

`C-x 8 RET` followed by either the code point in hex or the name of the 
official Unicode name of the character.

## Find information about a character

`C-u C-x =` will give information about the character under the cursor.

## Determine encoding of open file

Type `C-h C RET`. (Note that’s an upper case C.) This will tell you the coding
system for the current buffer and much more.
