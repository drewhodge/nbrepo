# emacs:bookmarks

## Basic usage

Basic bookmarking commands:

  - `C-x r m` – set a bookmark at the current location (e.g. in a file)
  - `C-x r b` – jump to a bookmark
  - `C-x r l` – list your bookmarks
  - `M-x bookmark-delete` – delete a bookmark by name

Your personal bookmark file is defined by option ‘bookmark-default-file’, 
which defaults to `~/.emacs.d/bookmarks` in the most recent Emacs versions 
and to `~/.emacs.bmk` in older versions. The file is maintained automatically 
by Emacs as you create, change, and delete bookmarks.

## Bookmark list

Command `bookmark-bmenu-list`, bound to `C-x r l`, provides a convenient menu
to access bookmarks.

The bookmark list (buffer `*Bookmark List*`) is like Dired or BufferMenu for 
bookmarks. (Emacs sometimes calls it the “bookmark menu list”, which is a misnomer.)

Some keys in `*Bookmark List*`:

`a` – show annotation for the current bookmark
`A` – show all annotations for your bookmarks
`d` – mark various entries for deletion (‘x’ – to delete them)
`e` – edit the annotation for the current bookmark
`m` – mark various entries for display and other operations, (‘v’ – to visit)
`o` – visit the current bookmark in another window, keeping the bookmark list open
`C-o` – switch to the current bookmark in another window
`r` – rename the current bookmark
