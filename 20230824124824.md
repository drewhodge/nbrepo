# haskell: Coding guidelines

Good Haskell Style

All  your  submitted  programming  assignments  shouldemerge creativelyfrom the following style guidelines.  Programming is just as much social artform as it is engineering discipline, and as any artist knows, constraints serveto enhance rather than quench creativity.These guidelines will be extended as the semester progresses.

  - DO use `camelCasefor` function and variable names.

  - DO use descriptive function names, which are as long as they need to be but no longer than they have to be.  Good:solveRemaining.  Bad:slv.  Ugly:solveAllTheCasesWhichWeHaven’tYetProcessed.

DON’Tuse tab characters.  Haskell is layout-sensitive and tabs MessEverything Up.  I don’t care how you feel about tabs when coding inother languages.  Just trust me on this one.  Note this does not meanyou need to hit space a zillion times to indent each line; your FavoriteEditor ought to support auto-indentation using spaces instead of tabs.

DOtry to keep every line under 80 characters.  This isn’t a hard andfast rule, but code that is line-wrapped by an editor looks horrible.

DOgive  every  top-level  function  a  type  signature.   Type  signaturesenhance documentation, clarify thinking, and provide nesting sites forendangered bird species.  Top-level type signatures also result in bettererror messages.  With no type signatures, type errors tend to show upfar from where the real problem is; explicit type signatures help localizetype errors.

Locally  defined  functions  and  constants  (part  of  aletexpression  orwhereclause) do not need type signatures,  but adding them doesn’thurt  (in  particular,  the  argument  above  about  localizing  type  errorsstill applies).

DOprecede every top-level function by a comment explaining what itdoes.

DOuse-Wall.   Either  pass-Walltoghcon  the  command  line,  or(easier) put {-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wall #-}at the top of your.hsfile.  All your submitted programs should compilewith no warnings.

DO, as much as possible, break up your programs into small functionsthat do one thing, and compose them to create more complex functions.

DOmake all your functionstotal.  That is, they should give sensibleresults (and not crash) for every input.
