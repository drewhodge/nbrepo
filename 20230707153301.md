In Emacs bookmarking these three things are different but related:

1. the bookmark list
2. the bookmark file
3. the bookmark-list display (buffer ‘*Bookmark List*’, aka the bookmark “menu
   list”, a misnomer)

It is important to keep these three straight and understand their differences in
practice, in particular, when they do and do not represent the same set of
bookmarks.

*#1* is in memory. It is the current set of bookmarks. When you add, rename,
delete, etc. a bookmark, this list is updated.

*#2* is on disk. It is a persistent record of a set of bookmarks.

The bookmark list (#1) is the current value of internal variable
`bookmark-alist`. The bookmark file (#2) can be anywhere. Its default filename
is the value of user option `bookmark-default-file`.

The bookmark list is typically initialized from the bookmark file — referred to
as loading your bookmarks, but you can also create bookmarks (adding them to the
list) without ever saving them to disk.

The bookmark list can be saved to the bookmark file — referred to as saving your
bookmarks — either automatically or on demand. But it is not necessarily saved.
Even if it has been saved in the past, that does not mean that at any given time
the bookmark list corresponds exactly to the bookmark file.

The list and the file can often become out of sync. In an Emacs session, the
bookmark list rules. After an Emacs session, the bookmark file rules (it is all
there is). You can use `C-x x L` ('bmkp-switch-bookmark-file-create`) to sync
(revert) the list to reflect the file — just accept the default value,
“switching” to the same file.

The bookmark-list display (*#3*) is a snapshot view of the bookmarks in the
bookmark list. As such, what you see there reflects the state of the bookmark
list at some point in time. So here again, the two, list and display, can be out
of sync. Hitting `g` in the bookmark-list display refreshes it to accurately
reflect the current bookmark list (*#1*). Some other operations in the display
also keep it synced with the list.

Using a prefix argument (`C-u g`) syncs the display (*#3*) and the list (*#1*) to
the file (*#2*). This can be useful when some other process (e.g., another Emacs
session) updates the bookmark file or when you want to abandon changes to the
current bookmark list and any of the current bookmarks. Outside the
bookmark-list display, you can use command `bmkp-revert-bookmark-file` to do
this.

You can load different bookmark files, either adding their bookmarks to those
already in the current bookmark list or replacing them.

The most important takeaway from this section is that *#1* (list), *#2* (file), and
*#3* (display) can be out of sync, and they often are. And that can be useful.
