# emacs: Built-in elisp cheat sheet

1. Invoke: `M-x shortdoc-display-group`
2. Pick a category of elisp functions

When you open a shortdoc group you’ll see example
code for each listed function, along with the
output of said function, and hyperlinks to the
Info manual entry (if there is such an entry.)
If there’s no manual entry, Emacs will instead
describe the function.
